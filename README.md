# cqcpy: Some quantum chemistry utilities in python
These utilies exist to provide some generally usefuly functionality for development
and testing of quantum chemistry code. They are not intended to be efficient with regards
to memory or computation.

## Prerequisites
+ numpy
+ pyscf (optional)

## Features
+ coupled cluster energy and amplitude equations
+ functions/classes for storing and manipulating determinant strings
+ compute Fermi-Dirac occupations and related quantities
+ convenience functions for getting integrals from pyscf in various formats
+ classes/functions for storing and transforming some commonly found tensor structures
+ functions to generate random tensors useful for various tests
